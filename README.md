# Kata Exercises

I was recently asked to completed a Kata coding exercise (http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) as part of a recruitment process, having spent a decent amount of time working on a number of Codility exercises (https://app.codility.com --> https://github.com/AndyThurgood/Codility) that were very similar, I managed to get pretty far into this exercise in the 40 (ish) minutes I was allocated.

I've since spent a bit more time tidying up my solution and attempting to finish the final few steps of the exercise, as well as write another one of the available Katas (http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-2/) to see how I faired on that one (I came to a halt at the first refactor point).

Ultimately, these kata exercises are designed to encourage a TDD based approach to solving a problem, by replicating a typical real-world state where requirements are laid out and subsequently change. I'd suggest that this test is probably a better recruitment tool and more rounded way to evaluate someoneâ€™s development skill than the aforementioned Codility.
